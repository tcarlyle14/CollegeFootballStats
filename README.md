Communication Contract:
1. For which teammate did you implement “Microservice A”?
    - Brenton Wooley

2. What is the current status of the microservice? Hopefully, it’s done!
    - The microservice is complete

3. If the microservice isn’t done, which parts aren’t done and when will they be done?
    - N/A

4. How is your teammate going to access your microservice? Should they get your code from GitHub (if so, provide a link to your public or private repo)? Should they run your code locally? Is your microservice hosted somewhere? Etc.
    - Access through the microservice can be run locally and pulled from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/tcarlyle14/CollegeFootballStats
    - Once the repository is pulled. Simply run the main program (CFBstat.py) and the microservice file (nameMicroservice.py) at the same time. The microservice will be automatically called by interacting with the main program.

5. If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do? Can you be available to help them? What’s your availability?
    - If my teammate cannot access/call my microservice, they can contact me on discord or teams. From there we can set up a meeting to troubleshoot. I am available anytime 10am-10pm EST.

6. If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you?
    - If they cannot access/call my microservice they should notify me by EOD 11/23/23, 48 hours before the due date to S3.6 - Discussion: "Microservice A" Validation, Code Review (due EOD 11/25/24).

7. Is there anything else your teammate needs to know? Anything you’re worried about? Any assumptions you’re making? Any other mitigations / backup plans you want to mention or want to discuss with your teammate?
    - No, since the microservice is automatically accessed from the main program, the user should not have any issues using it. Just make sure to run both the main program (CFBstat.py) and the microservice file (nameMicroservice.py) at the same time in order to use the program.
